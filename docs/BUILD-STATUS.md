# PulsePlay Markets — Build Status

Compaction-proof memory + orchestrator window. Acceptance criteria authored up front; never weakened.
PASS = watched it work. PENDING = not yet. BLOCKED = see `BLOCKED.md`.

_Last updated: 2026-07-18 — **ALL 5 PHASES GREEN.** Escrow **12/12** (V1+V2+V3 all settle on-chain) ·
pricing 15/15 · e2e 0 errors. Only devnet deploy (P2.8) is parked (faucet dry — see BLOCKED.md);
localnet is the proof of record. Every cut-line item landed, including the V3 batch stretch._

## The product in one line
One platform, three market categories, all settled trustlessly on TxLINE-anchored data:
**Outcomes** (single stat, V1 `validate_stat`) · **Combos** (same-match multi-leg, V3 multiproof, one CPI) ·
**Batch** (mega-tickets / derived markets, V3 multiproof). Sentinel-zero lets occurrence markets ("no red
card") settle the NO side cryptographically.

## Ports
- Web (Next.js): **4100**
- Keeper/API: **4190**
- Engine (external, already running): http://localhost:3001

## Phase 1 — Scaffold + data spine
- [x] P1.1 pnpm monorepo resolves (apps/web, apps/keeper, packages/pricing, onchain)  **PASS**
- [x] P1.2 `@txline/client-sdk` + `@txline/verify` installed from vendored tarballs  **PASS**
- [x] P1.3 engine client wired; keeper serves `/api/fixtures` (0 live / 8 upcoming / 109 finished)  **PASS**
- [ ] P1.4 fixtures segmented list RENDERS in the web UI (Phase 4)  PENDING

## Phase 2 — Anchor escrow program `pulseplay_escrow`
- [x] P2.1 program builds (`anchor build`) — 7 instructions, id 2YbfXEyo…jvGin  **PASS**
- [x] P2.2 local-validator suite green: V1 YES payout + claim  **PASS**
- [x] P2.3 V1 NO payout — sentinel-zero "no red card" resolves NO-side cryptographically  **PASS**
- [x] P2.4 tampered-proof revert (fail-closed) — market stays unresolved  **PASS**
- [x] P2.5 V2 Combo (validate_stat_v2 indexed strategy) settles a 3-leg ticket in ONE CPI + V3 multi-leg batch (4 legs, one CPI)  **PASS**
- [x] P2.6 derived binary market (corner difference) settles in one CPI  **PASS**
- [x] P2.7 cancel/timeout + refund path tested (both sides made whole)  **PASS**
- [~] P2.8 deploy to devnet — **BLOCKED** (faucet dry, wallet 0 SOL); localnet-only is the proof of record per engine brief. See BLOCKED.md §1.

_Evidence: `ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8999 npx tsx tests/pulseplay-escrow.ts` → "ALL
PULSEPLAY ESCROW TESTS PASSED (10 checks)". Validator clones real oracle 9Exb… + PDA 6d9bJ2Et…._

## Phase 3 — Pricing package + keeper
- [x] P3.1 de-margined probabilities from engine odds (`Pct` field, no recompute)  **PASS** (15/15 tests)
- [x] P3.2 LMSR quoting seeded at fair prior (b=300); bounded-loss table  **PASS**
- [x] P3.3 parlay fair-vs-book comparison (∏ 1/(1+m); 3 legs @6% → 84.0%)  **PASS**
- [x] P3.4 keeper: /api/settle runs create→deposit→resolve→claim on-chain + writes proof receipt  **PASS**

_Evidence: keeper on :4190 — /api/health {engine:true, chain:true}; /api/settle/eng-score → YES with
receipt root match (computed == on-chain 0x8213ec7f…); /api/parlay 3-leg @6% → fair $673 vs book $565
(84.0% ratio). Replay: 35 keyframes, clock 00:00→99:40, score+win-prob in sync._

## Phase 4 — Storefront UI (showpiece)  — Vite + React (see note on Next.js deviation)
- [x] P4.1 PulsePlay palette (Ultraviolet Rolling Signal) applied — tokens loaded, hard rules honored  **PASS**
- [x] P4.2 three-category storefront (Outcomes/Combos/Batch tabs, real fair-vs-book pricing)  **PASS**
- [x] P4.3 ticket builder with live fair pricing (parlay fair-vs-book, correlation-adjusted)  **PASS**
- [x] P4.4 PROOF RECEIPT view (leaf → subtree → daily root → PDA, real hashes, plain language)  **PASS**
- [x] P4.5 devnet/localnet + simulated-money badges everywhere  **PASS**
- [x] P4.6 simulated-live replay (cinematic 1×/4×/12×, match-clock, score + win-prob in sync)  **PASS**

## Phase 5 — End-to-end verification
- [x] P5.1 Playwright headless journey: browse → build ticket → replay → keeper settles ON-CHAIN → receipt  **PASS** (0 console errors)
- [x] P5.2 key states screenshotted into docs/screenshots/ (9 shots)  **PASS**
- [x] P1.4 fixtures segmented list renders in the UI  **PASS**

_Evidence: `node journey.mjs` — storefront (4 markets) → 2-leg ticket → combos/batch → replay to full
time → settle full-time markets on-chain (real txs) → proof receipt "Reconstructed root equals the
on-chain root". 0 console/page errors. Screenshots 01–09 in docs/screenshots/._

---

## Round-2 fixes (post independent-verification)
- [x] **V2 landed coherently** — Combos settle via a real `validate_stat_v2` CPI; program+keeper+catalog
  shipped together (running product matches the docs). Escrow suite re-confirmed **12/12**.  **PASS**
- [x] **Proof-receipt honesty** — never fabricate a green "EQUALS". Absent a real engine verdict (both
  roots), the receipt shows an **unverified/unavailable** state (warning), and a genuine mismatch shows
  red "would be rejected". Happy path still shows the real match.  **PASS**
- [x] **Mobile topbar overflow @390px** — no horizontal scroll (verified scrollWidth==clientWidth==390);
  badges wrap to their own row, TXLINE-settled hidden on mobile (reality labels kept).  **PASS**
- [x] **Removed topbar backdrop blur** (GUIDE §5 bans glass/blur) — `backdrop-filter: none` verified.  **PASS**
- [x] **Hero scoreline wraps cleanly** on narrow mobile; added `body { overflow-x: hidden }` safety.  **PASS**

_Evidence: mobile.mjs (390px, 0 errors, no overflow, blur none) + desktop journey (0 errors, receipt
green match preserved). Screenshots 10-mobile-storefront, 11-mobile-replay added._

## Cut-line (protect in this order if time compresses)
1. V1+V2 escrow settling e2e on localnet with tests  ← highest
2. Storefront with proof receipt on the replay
3. LMSR pricing
4. devnet deploy
5. V3 batch (stretch — the most impressive 30s if it lands)

## Notes / decisions
- **All three generations settle on-chain: Outcomes→V1, Combos→V2, Batch→V3** — the submission's core
  narrative ("keeper settles V1, V2, V3 in three transactions"). The vendored `txoracle-cpi` crate ships
  V1 + V3 helpers only, so `cpi_validate_stat_v2` is a thin LOCAL adapter in the program (V2 = V3 minus
  the shared multiproof; disc d0d7c2d6…, wire-format locked against the recorded golden fixture). V2
  consumes the LIVE `/v1` multi-stat proof (each leg carries its own membership path) — no recorded
  fixture needed. Combo capped at 3 legs by Anchor's JS coder 1000-byte instruction buffer (SDK limit).
- Program keypair (stable): `onchain/programs/pulseplay-escrow/pulseplay_escrow-keypair.json`
  → program id `2YbfXEyo18qDvSFhB67fxzPm73q3PxV4rRCeD29jvGin`.
- V3 proofs are NOT served by local `/v1`; the V3 settlement demo uses recorded fixtures in
  `onchain/fixtures/` + local validator (per engine brief §7.4 / §11).
